Hi im raul,  i am from barcelona, im 30 and i 've been working for 10 years in social security as an administrative assistant in emergency 
healthcare services, i finished "Higher education" in cross-platform applications development recently but i remained in the current
 job because i didn't enjoy the field much, and with this covid thing 
happening i had a lot of time to think about my future and myself and i decided it was time to leave the comfort zone and seek for a new 
career path in a this kind of "new" interesting  sector of TI and this seems like the best place for it
